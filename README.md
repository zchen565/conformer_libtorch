# conformer_libtorch

a libtorch version of conformer encoder with a simple decoder

strictly following the paper of Conformer

(this is model implementation, training is currently not supported, I extracted the tensor for future use with preprocess.py)

## Instruction
sh install.sh
sh prepare.sh
sh run.sh

## NOTE
this is not complete, I am not able to get a full training. Still too challanging for me. 

All the code can be compiled !

but still has some issues, 

I am not able to get a full training.

Libtorch still have some issue

The register_buffer has device issue that I cannot deal with
